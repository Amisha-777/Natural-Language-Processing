# Natural Language Processing in Python

NLTK, spaCy, and Scikit-learn are all open-source Python libraries used for various aspects of natural language processing (NLP) and machine learning tasks. Here's an overview of each:

1. NLTK (Natural Language Toolkit): 
NLTK is a comprehensive library designed for NLP tasks. It provides a wide range of tools for tokenization, stemming, tagging, parsing, and semantic reasoning. NLTK is particularly popular in academic settings and is often used for teaching and research purposes.

2. spaCy:
spaCy is a more modern NLP library designed for production use. It's known for its speed and efficiency, particularly in syntactic parsing. spaCy offers pre-trained models for various languages and is built with a focus on performance and ease of use.

3. Scikit-learn:
While not exclusively an NLP library, Scikit-learn is a general-purpose machine learning library that includes tools for text processing and classification. It provides a wide range of algorithms for data analysis, predictive modeling, and statistical learning.
