# Text Mining 🔍

Text mining is the process of extracting valuable information and insights from unstructured text data. It involves analyzing large volumes of text to discover patterns, trends, and hidden relationships. 📚 Text mining combines techniques from linguistics, computer science, and artificial intelligence to transform raw text into structured data that can be analyzed.

## Text Mining Concepts

### 1. Tokenization 🧩

Tokenization is the process of breaking down text into individual words, phrases, symbols, or other meaningful elements called tokens. This is typically the first step in text analysis, making it easier to work with text data in natural language processing tasks.

Example:
- Input: "The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog."
- Output: `["The", "quick", "brown", "fox", "jumps", "over", "the", "lazy", "dog", "."]`

### 2. Stopword Removal 🚫

Stopwords are common words that don't carry significant meaning in text analysis (e.g., "the", "is", "at", "which"). Removing these words helps reduce noise in the data and focuses the analysis on more meaningful content.

Example:
- Input: `["The", "quick", "brown", "fox", "jumps", "over", "the", "lazy", "dog"]`
- Output: `["quick", "brown", "fox", "jumps", "lazy", "dog"]`

### 3. Stemming and Lemmatization 

Both stemming and lemmatization aim to reduce words to their base or root form, but they use different approaches:

- Stemming: A heuristic process that chops off the ends of words. It's faster but can sometimes produce non-words. 
  Example: "running" → "run", "easily" → "easili"

- Lemmatization: Uses vocabulary and morphological analysis to return the base dictionary form of a word (lemma).
  Example: "running" → "run", "better" → "good"

### 4. Named Entity Recognition (NER) 

NER is the process of identifying and classifying named entities (e.g., person names, organizations, locations) in text. It's crucial for information extraction and understanding the context of text.

Example:
Input: "Apple is looking at buying U.K. startup for $1 billion"
Output: `[("Apple", ORG), ("U.K.", LOC), ("$1 billion", MONEY)]`

### 5. Sentiment Analysis 😊/😢

Sentiment analysis determines the emotional tone behind a series of words, used to gain an understanding of the attitudes, opinions and emotions expressed in text. 

Example:
Input: "I love this product! It's amazing and works perfectly."
Output: Positive sentiment (Score: 0.8)
