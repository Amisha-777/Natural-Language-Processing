# Text Representation Techniques

This document provides an overview of various text representation techniques used in Natural Language Processing (NLP).

## Techniques

### A. Corpus
A collection of text documents used for training NLP models. It serves as the foundation for various text-processing tasks.

### B. Bag of Words (BoW)
A simplistic text representation model that converts text into word frequency counts, disregarding grammar and word order.

#### **How it works:**
1. Convert text into a list of words (tokenization).
2. Count the occurrences of each unique word in a document.
3. Represent the document as a vector of word counts.

#### **Example:**
Consider two documents:
- Doc 1: "NLP is fun and interesting."
- Doc 2: "Machine learning makes NLP powerful."

After tokenization and vectorization:

| Word         | Doc 1 | Doc 2 |
|-------------|-------|-------|
| NLP         | 1     | 1     |
| is          | 1     | 0     |
| fun         | 1     | 0     |
| and         | 1     | 0     |
| interesting | 1     | 0     |
| Machine     | 0     | 1     |
| learning    | 0     | 1     |
| makes       | 0     | 1     |
| powerful    | 0     | 1     |


### C. Term Frequency (TF)
Measures how frequently a word appears in a document. Higher frequency words are considered more important.

#### **Formula:**  
\[
TF = \frac{\text{Number of times a word appears in a document}}{\text{Total words in the document}}
\]

#### **Interpretation:**  
- A higher TF value means the word frequently appears within the document, indicating its relevance.
- Does not consider word importance across multiple documents, which is why it's often combined with IDF.

#### **Use Cases:**  
- Search engines, text classification, and keyword extraction.

### D. Inverse Document Frequency (IDF)
A weighting factor that reduces the importance of commonly occurring words across documents and highlights rare terms.

#### **Formula:**  
\[
IDF = \log\left(\frac{\text{Total number of documents}}{\text{Number of documents containing the word}}\right)
\]

#### **Interpretation:**  
- Words appearing in many documents receive a low IDF score, meaning they are less informative.
- Rare words receive a high IDF score, meaning they are more significant.

#### **Use Cases:**  
- Enhancing the importance of domain-specific terms in large corpora.
- Improving search engine ranking.

### E. TF-IDF (Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency)
A statistical measure combining TF and IDF to evaluate a word's relevance in a document relative to a corpus.

#### **Formula:**  
\[
TF-IDF = TF \times IDF
\]

#### **Interpretation:**  
- A **high TF-IDF score** means a term appears frequently in a document but rarely in the entire corpus, making it highly relevant.
- A **low TF-IDF score** means the term is either too common across all documents or appears infrequently in the given document.

#### **How to interpret results:**
- If a word has **high TF but low IDF**, it is common across documents and not particularly useful.
- If a word has **low TF but high IDF**, it is rare but potentially significant.
- If a word has **high TF and high IDF**, it is important within the document and the corpus.

#### **Use Cases:**  
- Information retrieval, document similarity analysis, and text mining.

### F. N-grams
Sequences of 'n' consecutive words or characters used to capture context in text.

#### **Examples:**
- **Unigrams:** "Natural", "Language", "Processing"
- **Bigrams:** "Natural Language", "Language Processing"
- **Trigrams:** "Natural Language Processing"

### G. Document Similarity (Cosine Similarity)
A method to measure the similarity between two documents by calculating the cosine of the angle between their vector representations.

#### **Formula:**
\[
\text{Similarity} = \frac{A \cdot B}{||A|| \times ||B||}
\]

#### **Interpretation:**
- A cosine similarity value close to **1** means the documents are very similar.
- A value close to **0** indicates little to no similarity.
- A value of **-1** (in rare cases) suggests documents are completely dissimilar.

#### **How to interpret results:**
- **0.9 - 1.0:** Highly similar documents (e.g., near-duplicate articles).
- **0.7 - 0.9:** Moderately similar documents (e.g., different versions of a news report).
- **0.4 - 0.7:** Somewhat similar documents (e.g., related topics but different content).
- **Below 0.4:** Weak similarity or unrelated documents.

#### **Use Cases:**  
- Information retrieval, document clustering, and search engines.

### H. Word Embeddings
#### **What are Word Embeddings?**
Numeric representations of words in a lower-dimensional space, capturing semantic and syntactic relationships.
- Used to reduce dimensionality and understand word associations within a corpus.

#### **Comparison of Word Embedding Models**

| Aspect                | Word2Vec                                        | GloVe                                           | FastText                                     |
|----------------------|----------------------------------|----------------------------------|----------------------------------|
| **Type**             | Predictive Model (Neural Network-based) | Count-based Model (Matrix Factorization) | Predictive Model (Neural Network-based, with subwords) |
| **Training Approach** | Uses a shallow neural network to learn word vectors by predicting word context. | Learns word vectors by factorizing a word co-occurrence matrix. | Similar to Word2Vec but breaks words into subword n-grams. |
| **Variants**         | Skip-gram (predicts context words given a target word), CBOW (predicts a word given surrounding context). | No major variants, but can be trained on different corpora sizes. | Uses subword information (character n-grams), improving performance for rare words. |
| **Corpus Dependency** | Works well with a large corpus. | Needs a very large corpus for good performance. | Works well with both small and large corpora. |
| **Global vs. Local Context** | Focuses on local context by predicting word relations in short windows. | Captures global word co-occurrence statistics across the entire corpus. | Similar to Word2Vec but also considers subwords, making it more robust. |
| **Handling of Out-of-Vocabulary (OOV) Words** | Does not handle OOV words well (words unseen during training have no vector). | Does not handle OOV words well (unknown words are not represented). | Handles OOV words better by breaking them into character n-grams. |
| **Computational Efficiency** | Fast and efficient for large-scale training. | Slower as it requires matrix factorization. | Slower than Word2Vec due to additional subword computations. |
| **Use Cases** | Sentiment analysis, chatbots, document classification. | Information retrieval, word similarity tasks, machine translation. | Best for morphologically rich languages (e.g., French, German), better for handling rare words. |

### ðŸ”¹ **Which One Should You Use?**
- **Use Word2Vec** if you need fast training and your corpus contains frequent words.
- **Use GloVe** if you want to capture global word relationships and have a very large dataset.
- **Use FastText** if you are working with morphologically rich languages or need better handling of rare words.
