# Natural Language Processing (NLP) with NLTK & spaCy

This document provides an overview of Natural Language Processing (NLP) using two popular Python libraries:

- **NLTK (Natural Language Toolkit):** A traditional NLP library that relies on rule-based methods.
- **spaCy:** A modern, high-performance NLP library with an advanced machine learning-based pipeline.

## NLTK vs. spaCy: A Comparison

| Feature                 | NLTK                                      | spaCy                                      |
|-------------------------|------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------|
| **Processing Speed**    | Slower, requires multiple function calls | Faster, optimized NLP pipeline           |
| **Ease of Use**         | Requires manual preprocessing            | Simple `nlp(text)` handles everything    |
| **NER Accuracy**        | Less accurate, rule-based                | More accurate, ML-powered                |
| **Lemmatization**       | Uses WordNet                             | Built-in ML-based lemmatizer             |
| **POS Tagging**         | Rule-based approach                      | Context-aware tagging                    |
| **Scalability**         | Suitable for small datasets              | Ideal for large-scale applications       |

### When to Use NLTK vs. spaCy
- **Choose NLTK** if you need a rule-based, educational, or highly customizable approach.
- **Choose spaCy** if you require a fast, scalable, and machine learning-powered NLP solution.
